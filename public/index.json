Discover how to live a better life and achieve ataraxia.\nHi, I\u0026rsquo;m Nicholas.\r#\rI\u0026rsquo;m on a journey to escape my own mental prison of negative thoughts, beliefs which creates unnecessary stress and anxiety, so that I can achieve my good night sleep and peace of mind.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also saddened and tired of watching watching people suffer from stress they don\u0026rsquo;t need to carry. And seeing smart people make bad decisions because they\u0026rsquo;re trapped in mental loops they can\u0026rsquo;t see.\nI think we can hack our thoughts like biohackers optimize their bodies. Systems thinking, counter-intuitive truths, and ancient philosophy (ataraxia) gave me tools that actually worked.\nThis is me documenting what I\u0026rsquo;m learning and inviting others on the journey. If you\u0026rsquo;re ready to break free from the mental loops holding you back—welcome\n","date":"28 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Cognitive Liberators","summary":"","title":"About Cognitive Liberators","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"28 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/mental-loop/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mental Loop","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"28 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/stress/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Stress","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"TL;DR: You\u0026rsquo;re exhausted but can\u0026rsquo;t sleep. Your mind races at 2 AM. You calculate remaining hours, which makes it worse. This is the Stress-Sleep Spiral—a feedback loop where each element reinforces the next. The more you try to force sleep, the more elusive it becomes. Solution: Stop trying. Observe the pattern. Break the loop by accepting, not fighting.\nThe problem\r#\rIt\u0026rsquo;s 2:17 AM. You\u0026rsquo;re lying in bed, exhausted but completely wired. Tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s presentation loops through your mind—what if you forget your points? What if the client asks that question you can\u0026rsquo;t answer? You check your phone. Four hours and thirteen minutes until you need to wake up. Now you\u0026rsquo;re stressed about being stressed about sleep. You try deep breathing. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. You try counting sheep. Your mind wanders back to work. You calculate: \u0026ldquo;If I fall asleep RIGHT NOW, I\u0026rsquo;ll get 4 hours. That\u0026rsquo;s enough. I can do this on 4 hours.\u0026rdquo; 3:42 AM. Still awake. The alarm feels like a death sentence. Sound familiar?\nNaming it\r#\rThis is what is known as the Stress-Sleep Spiral—one of the most common and destructive mental loops we experience. Here\u0026rsquo;s how it works: Stress disrupts your sleep. Poor sleep impairs your cognitive function. Impaired cognition leads to mistakes and worse performance. Worse performance creates more stress. Which disrupts your sleep even more. It\u0026rsquo;s a self-reinforcing system. Each cycle makes the next one worse. And most people don\u0026rsquo;t see it as a system—they just feel like they\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;bad at sleep\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;can\u0026rsquo;t handle stress.\u0026rdquo;\nYou are in this loop if\u0026hellip;\r#\rYou\u0026rsquo;re exhausted but can\u0026rsquo;t fall asleep when your head hits the pillow Your mind races at night with tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s problems You dread bedtime because you \u0026ldquo;know\u0026rdquo; you won\u0026rsquo;t sleep well You calculate hours of sleep remaining, which makes you MORE anxious Mornings feel like punishment—hitting snooze repeatedly Coffee isn\u0026rsquo;t a pleasure, it\u0026rsquo;s survival fuel You make more mistakes when tired, creating more stress You\u0026rsquo;ve tried \u0026ldquo;everything\u0026rdquo; but nothing works You blame yourself for not being able to \u0026ldquo;just relax\u0026rdquo; How the loop forms\r#\rHere\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s actually keeping you awake:\ngraph TD A[Want to Fall Asleep] --\u003e B[Effort to Force Sleep] B --\u003e C[Anxiety About Not Sleeping] C --\u003e D[Body Stays Alert] D --\u003e E[Still Awake] E --\u003e F[Try EVEN HARDER] F --\u003e C PARADOX[THE PARADOX: The harder you try,the worse it gets] SOLUTION[THE SOLUTION: Stop trying and accept wakefulness] PARADOX -.-\u003e B SOLUTION -.-\u003e|Breaks| B style C fill:#ff6b6b style F fill:#ff6b6b style PARADOX fill:#fff3bf,stroke:#f59f00,stroke-width:3px style SOLUTION fill:#90EE90,stroke:#2d5016,stroke-width:3px The paradox: The harder you try to force sleep, the more anxious you become about not sleeping. That anxiety keeps your body in alert mode. Which makes you try even harder. Which makes it worse.\nThis is the counter-intuitive truth: effort defeats itself.\nYour nervous system can\u0026rsquo;t be forced into sleep. The more you try to control it, the more it resists.\nThe solution: Stop trying. Accept the wakefulness. Get out of bed when you can\u0026rsquo;t sleep.\nThis feels wrong. Your instinct screams \u0026ldquo;try harder!\u0026rdquo; But that instinct is what\u0026rsquo;s keeping you trapped.\nBreaking the loop\r#\rShort-term(Immediate)\r#\rWhen you can\u0026rsquo;t sleep and feel the loop starting:\nName it out loud: \u0026ldquo;This is the stress-sleep loop. I see it. It\u0026rsquo;s temporary.\u0026rdquo; Get out of bed: Don\u0026rsquo;t force it. Read something boring in dim light. Return when actually sleepy. Release the calculation: Stop counting hours left. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll get whatever sleep I get. Tomorrow will happen regardless.\u0026rdquo; Long-term\r#\rAddress the root cause: If work stress is chronic, the loop will persist. What needs to change? Build stress resilience: Exercise, boundaries, saying no—whatever reduces baseline stress Create sleep-positive conditions: Not through effort, but through environment (cool, dark, no screens, consistent timing) Practice non-attachment: Regular meditation/reflection to observe thoughts without identifying with them Signs you are winning\r#\rYou catch yourself entering the loop and can name it You notice the stress without spiraling into sleep anxiety Missing sleep one night doesn\u0026rsquo;t destroy your next day ( The loop happens less frequently and with less intensity Reflection\r#\rWhen did this loop start for you? Was there a triggering event? What time of night does the stress-spiral typically begin? What\u0026rsquo;s the dominant thought that keeps you awake? Closing\r#\rThe Stress-Sleep Spiral is one of the most common mental loops—and one of the most breakable once you see it as a system. You\u0026rsquo;re not broken. You\u0026rsquo;re not \u0026ldquo;bad at sleep.\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;re stuck in a feedback loop that\u0026rsquo;s doing exactly what feedback loops do: reinforcing itself.
