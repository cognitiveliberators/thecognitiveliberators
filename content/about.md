Mastering our thoughts and liberating from the prison of our mind. Discover how to live a better life and achieve equanimity.

# Hi, I'm Nicholas.

 I'm on a journey to escape my own mental prison of negative thoughts, beliefs which creates unnecessary stress and anxiety, so that I can achieve my good night sleep and peace of mind, which is what I deem as a good life.

I'm also saddened and tired of watching watching people suffer from stress they don't need to carry. And yes... too much chronic stress can lead to heart diseases and ultimately death. 

This is me documenting what I'm learning and inviting others on the journey.
